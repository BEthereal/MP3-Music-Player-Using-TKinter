Made MP3 Music Player Using TKinter In Python
Audio is an important source of communication and is just as important today
as text. We know that audio files are digital files. So you need a tool to run the digital
files, or in other words to play the files. Without this tool or player, we can never listen to
music, movies or the contents of an audio file. So we need music players. This device is
used to play music and other digital audio files. You can do it yourself, without having to
download and install premium music players. The music player GUI project idea tries to
emulate the physical music player. This program allows you to play songs, music and all
music files on your desktop or laptop. Using Python is a basic programming application
built using the Python programming language .It is a GUI program created using the
Python Tkinter pygame libraries. The music player application must be able to play a
song, create and display a playlist, pause and resume a long song, and change the
song. play the previous or next song.
